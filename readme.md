**To release or not to release - project overview**\
There are two components in this project:
1. Custom environment for Gym (http://gym.openai.com/) containing the simulation
of a production system (system parameters are based on literature). 
This environment allows a reinforcement learning agent to interact with the production
system and learn from its interactions with the system. 
See gym-jobshop/readme_gym_jobshop.md for installation 
instructions for the custom environment. 

2. An example implementation of a reinforcement learning agent for this environment
