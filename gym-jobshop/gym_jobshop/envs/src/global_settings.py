processing_times_multiplier = 1  # Each step, the affected machines (bottleneck machines) subtract
# 1 * processing_times_multiplier from their
# current order's remaining processing time. Thus a processing_times_multiplier > 1 means that machines subtract MORE
# than the default amount of remaining processing time from the order, which means that the capacity of the machine
# is increased. If the processing_times_multiplier were below 1, this would mean that the capacity of the machines are
# lower than the default value and thus the machines subtract less remaining processing time and take longer to
# process orders. As this is not a desired behaviour, we only consider processing_times_multiplier > 1.
# A processing_times_multiplier of 1 is the default value (subtract 1 each step).
