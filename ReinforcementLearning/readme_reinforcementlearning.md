**Reinforcement Learning applied to the gym-jobshop environment**

There are three agents inside the Agents folder:
1. RL agent that uses the average reward adjusted algorithm to learn and predict (based on Schneckenreither 2019 and Stable Baselines 3)
2. Random agent without any RL capabilities that takes random actions (just for evaluation)
3. Default agent without any RL capabilities that only does a fixed default action (just for evaluation)

The cool stuff happens with the RL agent, although it doesn't learn properly at the moment.


Todo:
action works only with a scalar -->need to document
this later
