**Reinforcement Learning applied to the gym-jobshop environment**
1. Custom changes to Stable Baselines3 DQN algorithm
    
    (add average reward adjustment)
2. RL agent based on average reward adjusted DQN algorithm
3. Non-RL agent taking random action/fixed action


IMPORTANT:
action works only with a scalar -->need to document
this later
